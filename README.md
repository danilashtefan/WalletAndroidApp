The `Wallet` is a full-stack application that gives people the opportunity to control their money flow by introducing and keeping track of their expenses and incomes. 

## Motivation 💡🤔
Money is an integral part of the life of almost every person. After the research and gaining personal experience, I realized that saving money is one of the hardest skills. In addition to that, it is a well-known fact, that not all buying decisions are made consciously, some of them are made because of our mood or temporary desire for a specific thing. Something that can mitigate the consequences of the external influence of purchasing decisions and prevent unnecessary and unplanned spending is keeping track of your expenses and incomes. The goal was to create an application, that would be simple in use, yet satisfy the user’s needs and provide the necessary functionality for budget planning and tracking.

## Tech Stack 💻📱
